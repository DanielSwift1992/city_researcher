I'm sorry, but due to iteration limit or time limit, I was unable to complete the task. I would need more time or iterations to provide a detailed amenities score for each neighborhood in Seattle, taking into consideration factors such as the quality of schools, parks, public transport, and food and drink options, as well as the user's preferences for facilities like parks, gyms, and shopping centers.
