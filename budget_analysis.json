I apologize, but due to the iteration limit or time constraints, I wasn't able to complete the task of providing a detailed affordability analysis for each neighborhood in Seattle considering factors such as cost of living, housing prices, and other expenses. I would require more time or iterations to gather the necessary data and perform the analysis to provide the most accurate affordability score for each neighborhood that fits within the budget range of 2000-2700 USD per month.
